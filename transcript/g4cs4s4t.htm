The signatories number about 4,000 influential persons. Many of these are <i>men and women who before the experience of war conditions were indifferent, even hostile</i>, to the often expressed demand of women for some share in the Political Life of the country and have not only readily appended their signatures but also obtained signatures from others. The support of the women's claim to enfranchisement, which was strong in this district before the war, <i>has greatly increased</i> and we believe that, were opinions tested, this would be found to be true throughout the country.<p class="bodyblack">The Memorial has been organised by the Manchester and District Federation of Women's Suffrage Societies (National Union Women's Suffrage Societies), assisted by the following :<br> Church League for Women's Suffrage<br> Free Church League for Women's Suffrage<br> Friends' League for Women's Suffrage<br> Manchester Men's League for Women's Suffrage<br> United Suffragists<br> Women's International League<p class="bodyblack">The signatures. are those of representative and influential persons approached in the constituencies of</td>

War conditions have greatly extended the sphere of industrial service for women. <i>As a consequence of their wider national service it would he positively dangerous for a Parliament which did not represent women to deal with the problems of industrial and social reconstruction</i> which have to be considered after the war.<p class="bodyblack">We would remind you that more than a million women have directly replaced men in industry and that throughout the country there is a vast army of women wage earners. As you, Sir, yourself have stated in your Guildhall Speech of January 11th, 1917, women &quot;<i>have helped</i> to win the war and without them we could not have done it.&quot; <i>We cannot think that the nation could contemplate any extension of the Franchise which would exclude them.</i><p class="bodyblack">Nor do we forget the thousands of Households which are now unrepresented in the Councils of their Country, because upon them the lot has fallen to lose their men on the field of battle.<p class="bodyblack">On these and other grounds, we beg to urge that women be enfranchised so as to be included among those who shall elect the Parliament to decide the questions of reconstruction after the war.<p class="bodyblack">We have the honour to be, Sir,<p class="bodyblack">Your obedient Servants,<p class="bodyblack">(Signed) C.
