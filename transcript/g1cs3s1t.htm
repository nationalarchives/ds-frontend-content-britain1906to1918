          <p class="bodyblack">FRANK OWEN was the son of a journeyman carpenter who had died of consumption when the boy was only five years old. His mother earned a scanty living as a needlewoman, and when Frank was thirteen he went to work for a master decorator who was a man of a type that has now almost disappeared, being not merely an employer but a craftsman of a high order, and Frank acquired a knowledge of decorative painting and design, and graining and sign writing. <p class="bodyblack">His mother died when he was twenty-four, and a year afterward he married the daughter of a fellow-workman. <p class="bodyblack">In those days trade was fairly good, although there was not much demand for the more artistic kinds of work, still the fact that he was capable of doing them, if required, made it comparatively easy for him to obtain employment. They had one child - a boy - and were very happy and for some years all went well. But gradually this state of things altered. Broadly speaking, the change came slowly and imperceptibly, although there were occasional sudden fluctuations.<p class="bodyblack">Even in summer Owen could not always find work, and in winter it was almost impossible to get a job of any sort. At last, about twelve months previously, he determined to leave his wife and child at home and to try his fortune in London, intending to send for them when he got employment. <p class="bodyblack">It was a vain hope. He found London, if anything, worse than his native town. Wherever he went he was confronted with the legend: 'No hands wanted'. He walked the streets day after day; pawned or sold all his clothes save those he stood in, and stayed in London for six months, sometimes starving and only occasionally obtaining a few days' or weeks works'.<p class="bodyblack">At the end of that time he was forced to give in. The privations he had endured, the strain on his mind, and the foul atmosphere of the city combined to defeat him. Symptoms of the disease that had killed his father began to manifest themselves, and, yielding to the repeated entreaties of his wife, he returned to his native town, the shadow of his former self.<p class="bodyblack">That was six months ago, and since then he bad worked for Rushton and Company, although occasionally when they had no work in hand he was &quot;stood off&quot; until something came in.<!-- #EndEditable -->
