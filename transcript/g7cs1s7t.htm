This applies, it seems to me, without qualification to the publication of news. It is very much more difficult to interfere in the matter of criticism, and we are all jealous of our tradition in that respect. Yet it would be easy to show that many of our failures during the present war have been substantially attributable to criticism made with the intention of rendering the existence of Government impossible. The main objections which have arisen in regard to the management of the Censorship have resulted from the fact that the purpose has been not to prevent information reaching the enemy, but to prevent information of which the enemy is in possession reaching the British public. That is the chief error into which the system has fallen, and it is an error that ought not to be tolerated, either in the interests of the press or of the country.&quot;</td>

The chief evil, I think, is the absence of correspondents at the front, which ought to be filled in some methodical way. I suggest that after a reasonable interval detailed accounts of operations, giving names and places and other details rendered innocuous by the lapse of time, ought in some way to be regularly provided. I am averse from arbitrary measures for suppressing criticism of the Government, but undoubtedly great harm is done when comments which misrepresent the mind of the country and underrate its efforts are repeated in Allied and neutral countries. There ought, I think, to be some way of preventing the export of home-made libels.&quot; </td>

It was creditable to the Government that they had so readily removed certain grievances which had been pointed out to them, but these grievances need never have arisen if there had been a friendly interchange of views beforehand. The really live question of the moment was whether there had been such an abuse of the right of free criticism in and by the press as called for active measures of repression. He did not think so. In any case repression of criticism would be a very dangerous practice to introduce.</td>
