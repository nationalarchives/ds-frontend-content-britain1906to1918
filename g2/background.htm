                            <p class="bodyblack">This is a really difficult question. Lots of brilliant historians in universities have argued about this for many years and they still cannot agree. The main arguments go something like this: <div class="gallerybulletg2">
                              <ul>
                                <li>Some historians believe that the Liberal reforms of 1906 onwards laid the foundations of the welfare state today. These historians believe that Lloyd George's reforms made changed attitudes. They convinced people that governments should help the poor and needy. This made it possible for later governments to bring in reforms like the National Health Service (in 1948). <li>Other historians see the Liberal reforms in very different terms. They believe that the Liberals were only interested in Britain's efficiency as a country. They brought in their welfare reforms because they were afraid that a sick and badly educated workforce would leave Britain lagging behind other countries like Germany. <li>Another view of the Liberal reforms is that they did not really have any plans at all. Some historians believe that the Liberals discovered a wide range of social problems once they came to power. They did not really have a clear plan on what to do so they adopted measures that seemed sensible as they went along. </ul>

                            <p class="bodyblack">Another factor that brought criticism was the cost of the reforms. The most spectacular example of this came in the years 1908-11. In 1908 the Liberals introduced Old Age Pensions. In 1909 the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, introduced what he called the People's Budget. In simple terms, this budget put taxes on to the wealthy to pay for welfare reforms like pensions. Lloyd George disliked the wealthy and was very happy to upset them by passing measures like the People's Budget. The Budget caused outrage. The House of Lords opposed it. They threw out the Budget even though the elected MPs in the House of Commons had approved it. This led to another election, which the Liberals won. The Liberals then passed the Budget and passed the Parliament Act (1911), which greatly reduced the power of the House of Lords.<p class="bodyblack">There were other critics of the reforms as well. The British Medical Association (which represented the doctors) often criticised the National Health Insurance Act and the provisions for school medical inspections and treatment. It should be said that they usually criticised the way the measures worked, rather than the measures themselves. <p class="bodyblack">Trade unions and friendly societies also criticised the detailed workings of the reforms, even though they supported the reforms themselves. For example, Friendly Societies complained that the doctors who gave treatment under National Health Insurance were not always the highest quality. Trade unions often complained the Old Age Pension was not high enough. <p class="bodyblack">One surprising group of critics were ordinary working people. They disliked having to pay 4d. a week out of their wages for National Insurance. There were many campaigns to get certain trades made exempt (e.g. domestic servants). However, once people saw the benefits of National Insurance - health care and unemployment pay - the criticisms grew less. </td>

This gave local councils the power to provide free school meals for the poorest families. In many ways this was a great success. By 1914 158,000 children were receiving free meals. On the other hand, the Act allowed local authorities to provide meals, but it did not make them do so. Also, the councils had to raise the money for meals from their local ratepayers.</span><p><span class="bodyblack">In 1907 the Liberals introduced compulsory medical inspections. The checks were free, but in some areas they were carried out more thoroughly than others. Another problem was that treatment was not free.
